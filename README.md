# AutoDriveCNN: Self-Driving Car with CNN

## Overview

AutoDriveCNN is a project aimed at developing a self-driving car system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system utilizes computer vision techniques to process real-time images captured by onboard cameras and predicts steering angles to control vehicle movements. 

## Features

- **CNN Model**: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network architecture for processing image data.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image features relevant to autonomous driving tasks.
- **Dataset Creation**: Gathers a dataset comprising images of road scenes, including lane markings, traffic signs, and other vehicles.
- **Model Training**: Trains the CNN model using the preprocessed image data to predict steering angles.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the CNN model on simulated and real-world driving scenarios.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tunes the model iteratively to improve accuracy and robustness.
